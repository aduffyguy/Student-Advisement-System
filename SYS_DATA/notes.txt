Do we actually need course catalog? or just offerings?
Should we limit the schedule recommendations to a 0-100 course number pool?
What should we do about minors?

--------------------
::FOR UNDERGRAD::
--------------------
-break down 8 main semesters.
  ^it, sd, cit, csd, each have their own unique 8 semester breakdowns
-create deviation path
  ^course correct to get back on main semester path
-total GenEds remaining vs semesters left + total amount completed of CS courses vs left to complete
  ^Spell out remaining things to be completed in "main semester units" visualization?

^::->FOR (First Visit) UNDERGRAD TRANSFERS / First semester of implementing the system
